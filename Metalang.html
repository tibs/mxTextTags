<h2><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Marc-Andr&eacute; Lemburg provides
<a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/lemburg/mxTextTools.html">mxTextTools</a>, 
a package of fast text manipulation tools for use with
<a href="http://www.python.org/">Python</a>. The tagging engine within that
package takes as input a set of tuples, the Tag Table, which tells it what to
do. Although simple in format, these tuples aren't particularly readable, and
indeed Marc-Andr&eacute; himself says:

<blockquote>
<p>"I admit, these tables don't look very elegant. In fact I would much rather
write them in some meta language that gets compiled into these tables instead
of handcoding them. But I've never had time to do much research into this, so
unless someone volunteers, it will stay like this for some time."
</blockquote>

<p>The following describes my implementation of a simple language which can be
used to represent mxTextTools tag tables, which I believe to be
easier to read and write than the underlying tuples, and which is transformable
into said tuples by simple textual manipulations.

<p><em>Note that the implementation is not yet complete, and whilst it is now
possible to write all of the parsing I need for the translator in the
language, there are still tuples that it is not possible to represent.</em>

<p>One outstanding matter is to decide on an extension for the text files
which contain examples of this little language. For the moment, I'm using
"<tt>.tag</tt>", although I can't help feeling that's probably used for other
purposes elsewhere. "<tt>.mal</tt>" did occur to me, but is perhaps too
obscure. "<tt>.mxtext</tt>" or "<tt>.mxtag</tt>" might have been better
solutions, but are perhaps a bit overlong...

<h2><a name="General aims">General aims</a></h2>
<p>Informally, my aims are:
<ul>
  <li>The format should be easier to read and write than the underlying tuples
      (otherwise there's little point in this exercise). Of course, this is
      to some extent a personal judgement.
  <li>Generally, using ideas from Python is a Good Thing, since that means
      that users have less to learn. Specifically, I've adopted indentation to
      indicate "blocks", and colons as a useful "is defined as" tag.
  <li>Having [X]Emacs Python mode able to do useful things with the language
      (specifically, handle indentation the way I want, and also colourise the
      text usefully) is a Good Thing to aim for. With luck, this may mean that
      other Python editors also cope well with it, e.g., PythonWin and IDLE.
  <li>I have aimed for a simple textual transformation from language to tag
      table - this means that the language should be able to cope with
      anything new added to mxTextTools over time, and also means that it is
      simpler to implement.
  <li>Whilst the ability to handle 100% of the tables that might be generated
      for use with mxTextTools would be very nice, I'll still be reasonably
      satisfied if the "normal" usages (i.e., those needed 99.9% of the time)
      are catered for, with complex or odd cases requiring hand-coding of tag
      tables.
</ul>

<h2><a name="Basic description">Basic description</a></h2>

<p>For obvious reasons, I'm going to assume that you already understand how to
write mxTextTools tag tables. This means that we can dive straight in with the
first example from the <a
href="http://starship.python.net/crew/lemburg/mxTextTools.html">mxTextTool homepage</a>:
<table>
  <font color="#000066">
<pre>
    tag_table = (('lowercase',AllIn,a2z,+1,+2),
                 ('upper',AllIn,A2Z,+1),
                 (None,AllIn,white+newline,+1),
                 (None,AllNotIn,alpha+white+newline,+1),
                 (None,EOF,Here,-4)) # EOF 
  </pre>
</font>
</table>
<br>which translates to:
<table>
  <font color="#000066">
<pre>
    tag_table = Table is:
        &lt;top&gt;
        'lowercase' = AllIn a2z F:next T:&lt;ignore&gt;
        'upper' = AllIn A2Z F:next
        &lt;ignore&gt;
        AllIn white+newline F:next
        AllNotIn alpha+white+newline F:next
        EOF Here F:&lt;top&gt;
  </pre>
</font>
</table>

<p>The first line indicates that we are producing a tag table (as opposed to an
individual tuple - this will be discussed later on) and assigning it to
<code>tag_table</code>. The use of "<code>is:</code>" to delimit the start of a
new block scope (i.e., a new table or tuple) seems to me to make it clearer
what is going on, and the colon has the added advantage of meaning "new block"
in Python as well (which also means that Python mode handles the subsequent
indentation rather nicely).

<p>The "<tt>&lt;top&gt;</tt>" is a label. I wanted to get rid of the "on
success go to the tuple at position +5" sort of logic from the tag
tables, since this is (a)&nbsp;difficult to work out, and (b)&nbsp;prone to
error if one ever has to add new tuples to the table.

<p>Offsets of plus one, minus one and zero are common enough that they have the
special keywords <tt>next</tt>, <tt>previous</tt> and <tt>repeat</tt> available
- having to use a label would be overkill in these cases, although it is, of
course, still possible if the user deems it to be clearer.

<p>(The label goes on a line by itself for the simple reason that
<table>
<font color="#000066"><pre>
        &lt;top&gt; 'lowercase' = AllIn a2z F:next T:&lt;ignore&gt;
</pre></font>
</table>
<br>doesn't look nice when indented.)

<p>The "<tt>F:</tt>" and "<tt>T:</tt>" conditions are translations of the
<tt>jump_no_match</tt> and <tt>jump_match</tt> elements. Obviously, specifying
a label means "jump to that label". Be aware that there is no whitespace
between the "<tt>F:</tt>" or "<tt>T:</tt>" and its target, and that the order
is required (i.e., the "false" target must come first, if present - this is
the same ordering as in the underlying tuples).

<p>As our next example, consider:
<table>
<font color="#000066"><pre>
    ctrlsymbol = Table is:
        Is "'":                             # hexquote
            IsInSet hex
            IsInSet hex
        IsInSet notalpha F:next T:MatchOk   # other
</pre></font>
</table>
<p>The general notation:
<table>
<font color="#000066"><pre>
     &lt;condition&gt;:
         &lt;suite&gt;
     &lt;statement&gt;
</pre></font>
</table>
(where <tt>&lt;suite&gt;</tt> is one or more statements) is exactly equivalent
to:
<table>
<font color="#000066"><pre>
     &lt;condition&gt; F:&lt;labelN&gt; [T:next]
         &lt;suite&gt;
     &lt;labelN&gt;
     &lt;statement&gt;
</pre></font>
</table>

<p>and is the preferred notation for that form. Note that technically there is
absolutely no reason not to have labels in the <tt>&lt;suite&gt;</tt> which are
jumped to from outside the <tt>&lt;suite&gt;</tt> (or vice versa) - an 'if'
block does not introduce a new scope. However, such usage may make it harder to
read the code, so think carefully before introducing it.

<p>Sometimes it is useful to define a single tuple by itself - for instance:
<table>
<font color="#000066"><pre>
    whitespace = (None,AllIn,' \t')
    opt_whitespace = whitespace + (MatchOk,)
</pre></font>
</table>
<br>This can be represented as follows:
<table>
<font color="#000066"><pre>
    whitespace is:
        AllIn ' \t'
    opt_whitespace is:
        whitespace F:MatchOk
</pre></font>
</table>

<p>I find that this form is most commonly used for introducing tables that are
used in more than one place (or conveniently separated out for clarity) - for
instance:
<table>
<font color="#000066"><pre>
    # Comments are fairly simple
    t_comment is:
        'comment' = Table is:
            Is '#'
            AllNotIn '\n\r' F:MatchOk
</pre></font>
</table>

<p>To illustrate most of the forms which can be used, here is a rather silly
example:

<p><table border="1" align="center">
  <tr>
    <td><font size="+1"><strong>The meta language</strong></font></td>
    <td><font size="+1"><strong>The translation</strong></font></td>

<h2><a name="Download and usage">Download and usage</a></h2>

<h3>Download</h3>
<p>The following are available for download:
<ul>
  <li><a href="Translate.py">Translate.py</a>
      (or see it <a href="Translate.py.html">colourised with py2html</a>)
      <br>This is the actual module we are discussing.

  <li><a href="Translate_tags.tag">Translate_tags.tag</a>
      (or see it <a href="Translate_tags.tag.html">colourised with
      py2html</a>, and here is the <a href="Translate_tags.py">translation into
      Python</a>, also available <a href="Translate_tags.py.html">colourised</a>
      <br>This is the tag definitions used within Translate.py, back translated
      into the metalanguage, suitable for translation (with Translate.py,
      of course) into a <code>.py</code> file which can be imported by
      Translate.py (if the <code>-import</code> switch is chosen) for use as
      tag definitions for translating the metalanguage. I think that makes
      sense...
</ul>

<p>You will also require
<a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/lemburg/mxTextTools.html">mxTextTools v1.1.1 or later</a>.

<h3>Usage</h3>
<p>The Translate module provides a class <bf>File</bf> which may be used to
translate a tag table (parsed using the table <bf>t_file</bf> which is defined
in Translate_tags.tag) into a text file. An example of its use is available in
the <code>main()</code> function in Translate.py.

<p>Used as a command line program, Translate.py can be used to translate tag
tables written in the metalanguage into straight Python files. Its normal usage
is explained by invoking the "<code>-help</code>" switch:
<table align="center">
<pre>
Usage: Translate [switches] &lt;infile&gt; [&lt;outfile&gt;]

        -stdout         -- write to standard output instead of a file
        -force          -- write to the &lt;outfile&gt; even if it already
                           exists (overwrite any existing file)

        -import         -- import tag table from Translate_tags.py,
                           instead of using the internal table

        -compare        -- compare the imported and internal tag tables
                           (development option!)

        -test           -- use our internal test data and write to stdout
        -pytag          -- use the interpreted tagging engine
        -debug          -- if -pytag, enable its debugger
        -diag           -- enable general debugging
                           Beware that this currently also writes line
                           numbers to the start of each line in the output,
                           so it doesn't emit legal Python...

        -help           -- show this text
        -history        -- show the module history
        -version        -- show the module version

If &lt;outfile&gt; is not specified, &lt;infile&gt; will be used with its extension
replaced by ".py".
</pre>
</table>

<p>The <code>-import</code> switch is used to prove that the translator can
indeed "bootstrap" itself, and will become the normal mode of operation in the
next release.
  
<h3>Python code</h3>
<p>The translator attempts to determine which code
"belongs" to it, and should thus be translated, and which code is Python
code and should thus be transmitted untouched. This is so that one can
do useful things like:
<table>
  <font color="#000066"><pre>
    chars = "abcdef"
    if morechars:
        chars = chars + "ABCDEF"
  </pre></font>
</table>

<p>It also has the advantage of allowing one to mix tag tables with normal
Python code, as one might naturally do if one were programming the tag
tuples directly. Of course, it is <em>slightly</em> dangerous, as is any
preprocessing of a file with mixed terminologies, and I don't guarantee
to accept more than a subset of proper Python code within the final
version of the translator.

<p>(NB: random code is <em>not</em> allowed within tag tables
themselves - it will be detected and commented out, with an appropriate
error message.)

<h3>Appearance of the output</h3>
<p>The output retains the indentation of the input, even though this may not
conform (for instance) to the indentation that [X]Emacs Python mode would
produce. This is mainly to make the equivalence of metalanguage and translation
more obvious, which also aids in diagnosis of any translation problems.

<p>Note that a comma is output after each entry within a tag table tuple,
including the final entry - this follows the normal "safe" convention when
writing lists, but can optionally be changed by changing the value of the
variable <code>WANT_LAST_COMMA</code> in Translate.py (I would note that one of
the major benefits of the language <em>to me</em> is that one does not
need to remember those trailing commas after each tuple - leaving them
out results in unobvious errors!).

<p>When closing parentheses are written at the end of a table, they are
written to a line by themselves, indented to match the indentation of the
start of the tuple. This introduces an "extra" line (i.e., a line that does not
correspond to anything in the input tag data), but on the whole seems clearer
than writing extra parentheses to the preceding line.

<p>Inline comments are retained and output. By default they are output at
column 40 (variable <code>COMMENT_COLUMN</code> in Translate.py), unless there
is already text there. This gives some chance that they will line up, but
obviously I'm not going to try too hard. Future versions of the translator may
make this more customisable.

<p>The "end of line" character is output as <code>"\n"</code>, and the
output is opened in text mode, so the result will depend on the platform
being used.

<h3>Error correction</h3>
<p>Some attempt is made to cope with "common errors" (read: "things I find
myself doing wrong too frequently"). Specifically:

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Target <code>MatchOK</code></strong>
  <dd>The target "<code>MatchOk</code>" has a lower case letter at the end. I
      can see that this might be a pitfall, so the erroneous target
      "<code>MatchOK</code>" will generate a message, but will otherwise
      be treated as if it were spelt correctly.

      <p><!-- yuck -->
      
  <dt><strong>Missing "<code>=</code>" in table block</strong>
  <dd>I've been known to write:
      <table>
	<font color="#000066"><pre>
        'fred' IsIn jim
	</pre></font>
      </table>
      <br>instead of:
	<table>
	  <font color="#000066"><pre>
        'fred' = IsIn jim
	  </pre></font>
      </table>

      <p>If the translator finds the former situation (and note that the tag
      object is optional, as normal), it will output an appropriate error
      message, but continue as if the "correct" code had been found.

      <p>Note that whilst I'm not entirely convinced that "<code>=</code>" is
      the best character to use here, I do feel the need for a delimiter here,
      and if one reads the normal Python "<code>=</code>" as "references",
      then one should read this operator as "tags".     

  <dt><strong>Missing "<code>is</code>" before colon</strong>
  <dd>I've been known to write:
      <table>
	<font color="#000066"><pre>
        'fred' = Table:
	</pre></font>
      </table>
      <br>instead of:
      <table>
	<font color="#000066"><pre>
        'fred' = Table is:
	</pre></font>
      </table>

      <p>If the translator finds the former situation (and note that the tag
      object is optional, as normal), it will output an appropriate error
      message, but continue as if the "correct" code had been found.

      <p>Note that the "<code>is</code>" is required to
      distinguish a table definition visually from an if block - basically,
      "<code>is:</code> translates as "start a new tuple" whereas a bare
      "<code>:</code>" means "start an if block".

<h2><a name="Restrictions">Limitations and Restrictions</a></h2>

<h3>Restrictions</h3>
<p>These are things that the user must bear in mind, which are not likely to
change.
<dl>
  <dt><strong>Identifiers</strong>
  <dd>Identifiers follow the normal Python rules (i.e., must start with a
      letter or underline, and may continue with letters, digits or
      underlines). Case is significant. Python keywords and mxTextTool commands
      (e.g., "Word", etc.) are not allowed. Somewhat arbitrarily, things like
      "Here", "MatchFail" and so on <em>are</em> currently allowed, but this
      potential ambiguity will likely be removed in a future version (I'm
      minded to disallow all the mxTextTools "special" words, for simplicity).

  <dt><strong>Labels</strong>
  <dd>The text within a label (i.e., between <code>&lt;</code> and
      <code>&gt;</code>) is an identifier, and thus follows the appropriate
      rules.

  <dt><strong>Indentation</strong>
  <dd>When calculating indentation, the same assumption is made as within the
      Python language itself - i.e., that any tabs are to be interpreted as
      moving to the next multiple of eight (8) spaces. As with normal Python,
      it is thus recommended not to mix spaces and tabs, just in case.

  <dt><strong>No spaces after <code>T:</code> or <code>F:</code></strong>
  <dd>This is not a bug, but beware that there is no whitespace between the
      <code>T:</code> or <code>F:</code> and its target. This is purely
      because I think it looks better that way. Some future version of the
      translator may attempt to give a useful error message if the user gets
      this wrong.

      <p><em>(This is about the only place where I intend to restrict the
      addition of "non-significant" whitespace. In particular, whitespace
      around "+" signs is legal, and whitespace before and after "(" and ")"
      will be allowed when I support function calls, etc.)</em>
</dl>

<h3><a name="Limitations">Limitations</a></h3>
<p>These are likely to be resolved in future versions of the translator.
<dl>
  <dt><strong>Strings</strong>
  <dd>Strings are only supported in a simple manner. Specifically:
      <ul>
	<li>It is not possible to include a single quote within a single quoted
	    string, or a double quote within a double quoted string (i.e., you
	    can do <code>"'"</code>, but not <code>'\''</code> or
	    <code>"\""</code>).

	<li>There is no support for triple quoted strings.

	<li>String concatenation by adjacency is not supported.
      </ul>
      <p>The first two limitations will be removed, probably in the next
      release of the software. The last probably will not (unless it turns out
      to be trivial).

  <dt><strong>Line continuation</strong>
  <dd>The use of "/" to continue a line is not currently supported. Nor are
      parentheses recognised as introducing automatic line continuation. Thus
      all tuple definitions must fit on a single line.
      
  <dt><strong>Tag objects</strong>
  <dd>At the moment, tag objects can only be identifiers, strings or
      (unsigned) integers.
      <br>Ultimately, most (if not all) object references should be allowable
      as tag objects (specifically, things like <code>a[b]</code>).

  <dt><strong>Tag table assignment</strong>
  <dd>For the moment, tag tables (at the outer level) can only be assigned to
      identifiers. For example:
      <table>
	<font color="#000066"><pre>
        fred = Table is:
           ...tag table definition...
       </pre></font>
      </table>
      <p>The intention is ultimately to allow any Python entity that would be
      valid on the left hand side of an assignment (which is, of course, what
      we generate when we translate the above).

      <p>(<em>Actually</em>, the same parse is applied for "outer" tag tables
      as for inner, so one could parse an assignment to a string or integer. Of
      course, Python itself would then grumble later on. A future version of
      the translator will catch this potential error and grumble.)

  <dt><strong>Commands and arguments</strong>
  <dd>There is almost no intelligence in dealing with commands and arguments as
      yet, save that the argument "<code>back</code>" gets translated to
      "<code>-1</code>" (this is for use with "<code>Skip</code>").

      <p>Arguments may currently be any of the words
      "<code>Here</code>", "<code>ToEOF</code>", "<code>To</code>",
      "<code>ThisTable</code>" or
      "<code>back</code>", or they may be a
      string, an (unsigned) integer or an identifier.

      <p>It is possible to "add" arguments with "<code>+</code>", so that
      <code>'abc' + "def"</code> is a legitimate argument (note that this does
      not apply for "<code>[Sub]Table is:</code>" lines).

      <p>No check is made that any particular argument makes sense with its
      command.      

  <dt><strong>Exceptions</strong>
  <dd>There are still a few "error" conditions in translation that result in
      exceptions. The intention is that these will be removed and replaced by
      error messages, with the translator continuing "as best it can".

<h2><a name="Still to do">Still to do</a></h2>

<p>Some of the following are also mentioned in
<a href="#Limitations">Limitations</a> above.

<dl>
  <dt><strong>Handling tables with T/F jumps</strong>
  <dd>When writing tag tuples directly, it is possible, for example, to do
      something like:
      <table>
	<font color="#000066"><pre>
        ('fred',Table,(...),+3,MatchFail)
	</pre></font>
      </table>
      <br>where false and true jumps are defined for an embedded Table. This is
      not currently possible with the metalanguage, because there is no obvious
      place to put the "<code>F:</code>" and "<code>T:</code>" clauses.

      <p>One might represent this "directly" as:
      <table>
	<font color="#000066"><pre>
	'fred' = Table:
	    ...
        F:next T:&lt;target&gt;
	</pre></font>
      </table>
      <br>but this would be breaking the Python convention that there are no
      block closing keywords (so, of course, Python mode also wouldn't support
      it, which is a Bad Thing), and anyway it looks really ugly.

      <p>Unfortunately, it looks like the "best" approach is just to move the
      true/false jumps to the start of the table definition:
      <table>
	<font color="#000066"><pre>
	'fred' = Table F:next T:&lt;target&gt; is:
	    ...
	</pre></font>
      </table>

      <p>I dither a little over whether a little more syntactic sugar would be
      nice here - for instance:
      <table>
	<font color="#000066"><pre>
	'fred' = Table with F:next T:&lt;target&gt; is:
	    ...
	</pre></font>
      </table>
      <br>but suspect in the end I'll err on the side of simplicity.

      <p>Note that there is <em>still</em> the issue of what one should do if
      the conditions are of the form
      "<code>F:&lt;label&gt;&nbsp;T:next</code>",
      which would normally be represented as the start of an if block - my
      inclination is to say at this point "well, that's getting too complex
      and we just won't cope", but I reserve the right to change my mind later
      on when I've worried about it a bit more...

  <dt><strong>Modifed [Sub]Table commands</strong>
  <dd>At the moment, it is possible to have "<code>+</code>" modifications for
      commands in a 'normal' tuple - for instance:
      <table>
	<font color="#000066"><pre>
        'fred' = Table + CallTag
	</pre></font>
      </table>
      <br>(although mostly by coincidence, if you actually read the tag
      tables!), but it is not possible to do this in an "embedded" table
      definition, such as: 
      <table>
	<font color="#000066"><pre>
        Table + CallArg is:
            ....
	</pre></font>
      </table>

  <dt><strong>Function calls</strong>
  <dd>It is not currently possible to recognised lines which include a function
      call as the argument to a command - for instance as in the following
      tuples:
      <table>
	<font color="#000066"><pre>
        'text' = sWordStart BMS('-->') F:next
        Skip len('</XMP>')
	</pre></font>
      </table>

      <br>It is also not possible to translate <code>CallArg</code>,
      <code>TableInList</code> and <code>SubTableInList</code> for similar
      reasons.

  <dt><strong>Continuation lines</strong>
  <dd>It is not possible to continue lines with "<code>/</code>" (as in normal
      Python).

  <dt><strong>Proper string handling</strong>
  <dd>Strings with escaped quote characters, and triple-quoted strings, need to
      be implemented.

  <dt><strong>Additional checking of TuplePlus</strong>
  <dd>When doing a TuplePlusLine, it would be nice to check if we knew the
      tuple we're adding to, and if so whether it already (i.e., by mistake)
      has a <code>F</code> or <code>T</code> condition. This would necessitate
      keeping a log of Tuples defined (but we couldn't <em>guarantee</em> to
      recognise a tuple by "name", of course - e.g., given
      "<code>tuple[3]&nbsp;=&nbsp;...</code>" we would not know what to do if
      we later referred to that as "<code>tuple[a]</code>".

      <p>Also, if the user does:
      <table>
	<font color="#000066"><pre>
        a = Table is:
            bbb
	</pre></font>
      </table>
      <br>then it would be nice to check that "<code>bbb</code>" is a tuple (or
      tupleplus) if possible (this is actually almost the same point).

  <dt><strong>Distinguish assignables</strong>
  <dd>It would be a Good Thing to distinguish assignables (e.g. for
      <code>Table</code>s) from tagobjs (i.e., as used in tuples) so we can
      grumble if the user uses the wrong sort at the wrong time.

      <p>The translator also needs to handle more valid Python targets for both
      assignment (of tag tables) and also for tag objects. I need to think
      about exactly how to do this - I don't <em>really</em> want to start
      having to be able to parse all legitimate Python source code explicitly
      "by hand".
